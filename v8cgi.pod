v8cgi - wrapper around V8 Javascript engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

v8cgi [B<-v>] [B<-h>] [B<-w> [B<-d> I<port>]] [B<-c> I<config_file>] I<main_file>

v8cgi reads the contents of I<main_file> and executes it using the V8 engine. v8cgi implements CommonJS's Modules proposal, which allows for easy distribution of code into several modules. v8cgi ships with many built-in modules; more of them are available as separate packages.
